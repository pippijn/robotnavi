@book{vba,
        abstract = {The fifth edition of \_Numerical Methods for Engineers\_ continues its tradition
                    of excellence. Instructors love this text because it is a comprehensive text
                    that is easy to teach from. Students love it because it is written for them--
                    with great pedagogy and clear explanations and examples throughout. The text
                    features a broad array of applications, including all engineering disciplines.

                    The revision retains the successful pedagogy of the prior editions. Chapra and
                    Canale's unique approach opens each part of the text with sections called
                    Motivation, Mathematical Background, and Orientation, preparing the student
                    for what is to come in a motivating and engaging manner. Each part closes with
                    an Epilogue containing sections called Trade-Offs, Important Relationships and
                    Formulas, and Advanced Methods and Additional References. Much more than a
                    summary, the Epilogue deepens understanding of what has been learned and
                    provides a peek into more advanced methods. Users will find use of software
                    packages, specifically MATLAB and Excel with VBA. This includes material on
                    developing MATLAB m-files and VBA macros.

                    Approximately 80\% of the problems are new or revised for this edition. The
                    expanded breadth of engineering disciplines covered is especially evident in
                    the problems, which now cover such areas as biotechnology and biomedical
                    engineering.},
